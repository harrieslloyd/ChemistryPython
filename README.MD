# CHEMISTRY PYTHON PROGRAMS

This repo has a bunch of python programs that can do basic-level chemistry. Those are all found in the `chem` folder. In the root, you'll see 3 other files: `newton.py` will do newton's method (calc), `ram.py` will do rectangular integral estimations, and `taylor.py` will find Taylor series. 

In the chem folder, you'll find all of the python files labeled with what they do. These files are the unoptimized, simple versions that work best on a computer. In the `newTI` folder, there are optimized python files for a TI-84 Plus CE Python Edition calculator. In order to use these, also upload the `MASS.8xl` file in the `ti` folder to your calculator. The rest of the stuff in the `ti` folder is old, except for `POLYATOM.8xp`, which is a TI-BASIC program that lists common polyatomic ions. Very useful.
